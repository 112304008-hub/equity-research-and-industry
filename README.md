## 1. AI ASIC Industry Overview

**Language:** Chinese  
**Format:** Slide deck (PPTX / PDF)  
**Role:** Team member (research, structuring, and writing)  
**Topic:** AI ASIC supply chain, growth drivers, risks, and investment ideas  

### 1.1 Scope & Objectives

This piece provides a structured overview of the AI ASIC industry and its role within the broader AI infrastructure stack. It aims to:

- Map out the **value chain** from IP & EDA, IC design, foundry, advanced packaging, to downstream applications (data centers, networking, consumer, automotive).  
- Compare **ASIC vs GPU** in terms of performance, cost, flexibility, and typical use cases.  
- Analyze how hyperscale cloud providers (CSPs) are driving ASIC adoption through self-developed accelerators.  
- Identify potential **investment candidates** and key factors to monitor going forward.  

### 1.2 Industry Value Chain

The deck summarizes the AI ASIC supply chain as:

- **IP & EDA:** ARM, Synopsys, Cadence – providing fundamental IP blocks and design tools.  
- **IC Design & Design Services:**  
  - Taiwan-based players such as Alchip (世芯-KY), Global Unichip (創意), Faraday (智原)  
  - Global players such as Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell (MRVL), MediaTek, etc.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Pure-play: TSMC, UMC, GlobalFoundries, SMIC  
  - IDM + Foundry: Intel, Samsung  
- **Packaging & Testing:** ASE, PTI, Amkor, KYEC, plus TSMC’s CoWoS and other advanced packaging lines.  
- **Downstream Applications:** Hyperscale data centers (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft), networking & 5G, consumer electronics, automotive, etc.  

### 1.3 Key Drivers & Industry Logic

Key growth drivers discussed in the deck include:

- Structural increase in **CSP capex** for AI infrastructure, with AI-related investment becoming a larger share of total spending.  
- The push for **better energy efficiency and lower TCO** in AI inference workloads, where ASICs can offer significantly lower cost compared with general-purpose GPUs for specific models.  
- The strategic desire of cloud providers to differentiate their AI services and reduce dependence on external GPU vendors.  

The analysis highlights a division of labor:

- **GPUs** remain strong for training and for environments where models and architectures change quickly.  
- **ASICs** are attractive for large-scale, stable inference workloads where model weights are fixed and cost / energy efficiency dominate.  

### 1.4 Case Study – Broadcom (AVGO)

The slide deck uses Broadcom as a case study to connect industry structure to a specific name:

- AI-related business has grown to a meaningful share of semiconductor solution revenue.  
- Gross margin is structurally higher than some competitors, reflecting strong IP and packaging advantages.  
- The company benefits from demand for custom accelerators (e.g., Google TPUs) and expanding advanced packaging capacity.  

### 1.5 Risks & Monitoring Points

The deck also discusses:

- **Technology risk:** new architectures that may change the balance between GPUs and ASICs.  
- **Customer concentration:** reliance on a small number of hyperscale CSP customers.  
- **Supply chain bottlenecks:** advanced packaging (e.g., CoWoS) as a limiting factor.  
- **Competition:** other design houses and CSP in-house chip projects.
